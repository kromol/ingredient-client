## Commercial Software
This is commercial software, owned by Relay Foods, not free software.  We unfortunately can't allow it to be used, in whole or in part, on any other site, commercial or otherwise.  It is hosted on GitHub to allow our distributed team of developers to contribute improvements, and to allow outside developers to suggest bug fixes.

## Installing and Running

* This is a single page application.  It can be served with any static HTTP Server (on OSX: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000).  A version is also currently hosted on Github Pages, [here](http://relayfoods.github.io/ingredient-client/src/index.html).  It will *not* function correctly if opened as a local file (i.e., file:///).

* To test: enter a UPC (product id) in the topmost textbox and press enter.  You can add ingredients to this upc by enterring them in the second textbox.  Click the save button in the bottom left to make your changes permanent.
